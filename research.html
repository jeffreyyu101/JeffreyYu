Being a hobbyist, I was able to combine my hardware, software, and 3D printer-specific skills to work on an independent engineering research project. My printer utilized a unique three-part assembly: an open reservoir, peristaltic pump, and extruder assembly. I came up the project idea all the way back in sophomore year, was able to learn many of the skills needed during the summer of 2017 and began work during my junior year. I continued to work on it through the summer of 2018 and plan on submitting the project to the Regeneron Science Talent Search. </p>

                    <p>My first high school research study investigated how sunscreen affects ocean water. Working with a team of three others, we collected gallons of seawater and studied the effects of how regular, water-resistant, waterproof, and biodegradable sunscreen had on the water quality. To our surprise, we discovered biodegradable sunscreen had the most detrimental effects. This study taught me a lot about the research process. I learned how to design and conduct a scientifically sound research experiment, run statistical tests, draw conclusions, and present our findings. </p>
